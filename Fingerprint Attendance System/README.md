# Fingerprint Attendance System

A WiFi-enabled fingerprint-based attendance system built using ESP32 and the R307 fingerprint sensor.  
Attendance events are logged in real time to Google Sheets via a web endpoint, with LOGIN / LOGOUT tracking.

## Features

- Fingerprint-based user enrollment with name and ID
- Real-time attendance logging to Google Sheets
- LOGIN / LOGOUT status tracking
- WPA2-Enterprise WiFi support
- EEPROM-based persistent storage
- Buzzer feedback for success, failure, and system events
- Serial-command–driven administration

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- R307 Fingerprint Sensor (UART)
- Active/Passive Buzzer (3.3 V compatible)
- Jumper Wires
- USB Cable / External Power Supply

## System Overview

1. Users are enrolled with fingerprint, name, and ID
2. On successful fingerprint match:
   - Timestamp is generated by ESP32
   - Status is marked as LOGIN or LOGOUT
   - Data is sent to Google Sheets via HTTP endpoint
3. Buzzer provides audible feedback for system actions

## Setup Instructions

1. Open the project in Arduino IDE
2. Select the correct ESP32 board and COM port
3. Update the following in the firmware:
   - WiFi credentials (WPA2-Enterprise supported)
   - Google Sheets Web Endpoint URL
4. Upload the firmware
5. Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud

## Serial Commands

- E → Enroll a new user
- P → Print all stored users
- C → Clear all stored data
- D → Delete an existing user
- U → Update an existing user

## Attendance Logic

- Each valid fingerprint scan logs:
  - Name
  - Comet ID
  - Timestamp
  - Status (LOGIN / LOGOUT)
- Status can be toggled per scan or assigned based on time.

## Google Sheets – Example Layout

Name        | Comet ID     | Time                | Status
------------|--------------|---------------------|--------
Aditya Raj  | COMETFWC015  | 2025-07-30 16:05:23 | LOGIN

## Status Field Definition

- LOGIN  → User entry / start of session
- LOGOUT → User exit / end of session
